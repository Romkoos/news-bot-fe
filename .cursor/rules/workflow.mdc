# Workflow Rules

## Project Context
- Framework: Next.js
- Documentation: 
   - In the root of the project, in the docs folder.

## Task Execution Workflow

Before implementing ANY task, follow this mandatory workflow:

### Step 1: Research & Context Gathering
1. Find the relevant documentation in the docs folder at the root of the project.
2. Identify existing patterns, conventions, and related implementations
3. Note any constraints or requirements from the documentation

### Step 2: Create Implementation Plan
1. Create a plan file in `ai-plans/` folder with the naming convention:
   ```
   ai-plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<short-task-description>.md
   ```

2. The plan file MUST include:
   ```markdown
   # Task: [Brief Title]
   
   ## Context
   - Ticket/Request: [reference if available]
   
   ## Objective
   [Clear description of what needs to be accomplished]
   
   ## Technical Approach
   [High-level approach and architecture decisions]
   
   ## Implementation Steps
   - [ ] Step 1: [description]
   - [ ] Step 2: [description]
   - [ ] Step 3: [description]
   ...
   
   ## Files to Modify/Create
   - `path/to/file.ts` - [what changes]
   - `path/to/new-file.ts` - [purpose]
   
   ## Testing Strategy (if needed)
   - [ ] [Test case 1]
   - [ ] [Test case 2]
   
   ## Rollback Plan
   [How to revert if needed]
   
   ## Open Questions
   - [Any uncertainties to clarify]
   ```

3. Present the plan to the user for approval before proceeding

### Step 3: Implementation
1. Only proceed after user approves the plan
2. Do only one step on time and wait until user approve till the new step
3. Update checkboxes in the plan file as you complete each step
4. Commit messages should reference the plan file

### Step 4: Completion
1. Mark all todos as complete in the plan file
2. Add a `## Completed` section with:
   - Date completed
   - Any deviations from original plan
   - Follow-up items if any

## Documentation
1. Search for relevant documentation in the docs folder at the root of the project.
3. After making any changes to the code, review the documentation and update it if necessary.


## Commands

- Before any feature work: "Let me check documentation and create a plan"
- To view current plan: Reference the latest file in `ai-plans/`
- To update progress: Edit the checkboxes in the active plan file
- Every time you make changes, make sure that support for multiple languages is taken into account.
- Every time you make changes, make sure that support for both dark and light themes is taken into account.
